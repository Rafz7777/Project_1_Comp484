    <p>This website documents my journey restoring a 1957 Vauxhall Victor F. Follow along as I bring it back to life!
      This project has been years
      in the making and first started back in 1999 when I saw it sitting in a tow yard among other vehicles. I passed
      this car almost every day
      and I was very interested in it due to the fact that it reminded me of a 'miniature' 1957 Chevy.
    </p>

    <h3>The Backstory</h3>

    <p>So after passing this car for a few months, I decided to stop in and speak to the owner about the car. Turns out,
      the car belonged to a
      retired owner of a towing company and happened to belong to a remnant of vehicles he was keeping for his own
      personal collection. I asked if the
      car was for sale but he quickly said no. He expressed how fond he was of the car and said he could not let it go.
    </p>
    <p>As time went on, I stopped by a few more times and before I knew it, we had become friends of a sort. The man was
      up there in age and I think he
      appreciated having me come around every so often for a visit to talk cars. On my second visit, I again offered to
      buy the car and once again, the
      offer was still no. But he definitely appreciated my persistence and how much I liked his little car.</p>
    <p>It was on the third or fourth trip that he finally relented and told me to make him an offer. I threw out a
      number ($1000) and he quickly countered
      with $2000. We met in the middle and settled on $1500. The little car was finally mine and I was excited to get it
      home and get to work.

    <h3>My Goal</h3>
    <img src="images/goal/goal_1.jpg" alt="Car before restoration" width="500" class="img-right">

    <p>My goal with this car is to restore it just as it came off the factory floor. I’d like to restore it as best I
      can with all the original specifications
      including original engine specs, paint, upholstery, etc. I think it’s very enjoyable and interesting to look at a
      car just as it was, and in this case,
      how it looked 68 years ago!</p>
    <p>With that being said, the biggest obstacle over the years has been sourcing parts. As you can imagine, finding
      original parts that were made for this
      vehicle is almost impossible! Yet, the parts do exist if you know where to look. As this car was imported from
      England, I’ve found the bulk of necessary
      parts over in the UK with a great deal of help coming from Facebook groups and the internet in general.</p>
    <p>Although the car pictured to the right is not my car, it illustrates nicely what my end goal is. It is the final
      color (Empress Blue) that I plan to paint my car in and serves as inspiration for my current project.
