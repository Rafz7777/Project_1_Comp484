    <h2>About the Car</h2>

    <img src="images/showroom_vauxhall.jpg" alt="Car before restoration" width="500" class="img-right">

    <p>The Vauxhall Victor F-Type was launched on February 28, 1957, featuring a unitary construction,
      American-influenced styling with a large glass area and heavily curved windscreen, and a scaled-down
      1955 Chevrolet Bel Air look. Production of the F-Type Victor ran until 1961, with almost 400,000
      units built, and it was known for its rapid and severe structural corrosion due to thin-gauge steel
      and design flaws. Despite early popularity and export success, the F-Type was eventually replaced by
      the slightly revised, less American-styled FB model in 1961. </p>

    <h2>Key Characteristics</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>American Styling:</strong> The Victor F-Type adopted American styling trends of the time, including a
        large, curved windscreen and sloping A-pillars, drawing inspiration from the 1955 Chevrolet Bel Air.</li>
      <li><strong>Unitary Construction:</strong> The car featured a monocoque body, which was a departure from
        traditional body-on-chassis construction at the time.</li>
      <li><strong>Large Glass Area:</strong> The car had a notably large amount of glass for its era, including a deeply
        curved windscreen and rear window, contributing to a bright interior.</li>
      <li><strong>Interior:</strong> It featured front and rear bench seats trimmed in Rayon and a two-tone trim was
        standard.</li>
      <li><strong>Engine:</strong> The initial F-Type was powered by a 1.5-liter (1508cc) four-cylinder overhead-valve
        engine producing 55bhp.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>History</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Launch:</strong> The F-Type Victor was launched in 1957 as a replacement for earlier models like the
        Vauxhall Wyvern. </li>
      <li><strong>Success:</strong> The Victor became a strong seller in the British market and was also notably
        exported, including to the United States and Canada via the Pontiac dealer network. </li>
      <li><strong>Facelift (Series II):</strong> A Series II model was introduced in 1959 with simplified styling to
        remove some of the more extreme American styling elements. </li>
      <li><strong>Corrosion Issues:</strong> A significant problem was the car's poor resistance to structural
        corrosion. This was attributed to several factors, including the use of thin-gauge steel to minimize weight and
        numerous trapped moisture points in the body design. </li>
      <li><strong>Successor:</strong> The F-Type was succeeded by the Vauxhall Victor FB, which went on sale in late
        1960 with a less overtly American design. </li>
    </ul>
